# GDB

## Print

### Print a register

`print/x <register>` Print the content of a register in hex format.

`print <register>` Print the content of a register in decimal format.

### Print memory content

`x/30i <address>` Show 30 instruction disassambled starting from the given address.

`x/30wx <address>` Show 30 items of 32 bit word (dword) starting from the given address.

`x/30gx <address>` Show 30 items of 64 bit word (qword) starting from the given address.

The address can be also read from a register (i.e. `x/30wx $eax` shows 30 dwords starting from the address contained in `$eax`).

## Others

### Call a function

GDB allows you to call a function while debugging. It only requires a running process.

Add a breakpoint or cause an exception to enter debugging and then call the function.

```bash
print (void) print_something()
```

Inside the first parenthesis put the function type.

Any parameters can be passed inside the second pair of parentheses.
